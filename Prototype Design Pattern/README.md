# Prototype Design Pattern

## Overview

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows cloning of existing objects without the need to know their concrete class. This pattern provides a mechanism for creating copies of objects efficiently, making it useful in cases where the cost of creating a new instance is higher than cloning an existing one. The Prototype pattern is especially beneficial for creating instances of complex objects or objects that have many configuration settings.

## Purpose

The Prototype pattern allows for creating new objects by copying an existing object, or "prototype." This technique avoids the overhead associated with creating objects from scratch and can be useful for dynamically generating objects with unique configurations. By using the Prototype pattern, new instances can be created with little variance from the original, making the process efficient and manageable.

## Structure

The Prototype pattern generally includes the following elements:

- **Prototype**: Declares an interface for cloning itself, typically with a `clone()` method.
- **ConcretePrototype**: Implements the cloning behavior defined in the `Prototype` interface.
- **Client**: Creates a new object by requesting a clone of an existing object.
