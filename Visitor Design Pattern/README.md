# Visitor Design Pattern  

## Overview  

The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations to an object structure without modifying the objects themselves. It separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, promoting flexibility and extensibility.  

This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with object structures where operations need to be performed on a variety of object types, and those operations may change frequently.  

## Purpose  

- To define new operations on an object structure without altering the classes of the objects.  
- To centralize operations that would otherwise be scattered across multiple classes.  

## Structure  

The Visitor Design Pattern consists of the following components:  

1. **Visitor**: An interface or abstract class that declares a visit method for each type of element in the object structure.  
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the operations defined in the Visitor interface.  
3. **Element**: An interface or abstract class that declares an `accept` method, allowing a visitor to access the element.  
4. **Concrete Element**: Implements the `accept` method to allow a visitor to perform its operation.  
5. **Object Structure**: A collection of elements to which the visitor is applied.
