# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Overview

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent of the way its objects are created, composed, and represented.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Abstract Factory pattern is to provide a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme. It helps in:

- Promoting loose coupling in the code.
- Facilitating the addition of new product types without changing existing code.
- Allowing for the creation of products that share a common interface.

## Structure

The key components of the Abstract Factory pattern include:

- **AbstractFactory**: An interface declaring creation methods for each type of product.
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the `AbstractFactory` interface to produce concrete products.
- **AbstractProduct**: An interface for a type of product.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the `AbstractProduct` interface.
